            <p>Scholars research microorganism to develop new medicine to save lives, scientists study  Physics to build high-tech devices to observe the universe. Then how can presence in VE benefit the society?</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Subjective Sensation</h2>

            <p>The experience and report of subjective sensation of "being there" during immersion in VE is related to most theories on presence. At the same time, this sensation is also a part of most definitions of presence.
            <br>One application of this subjective sensation is in the environment which is being experienced currently or been experienced in the past. The key result of presence is that one remembers the VE as a place rather than a set of pictures.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Task Perfoemance</h2>

            <p>"There is a pervasive belief that presence is causally related to performance...Despite the popularity of this notion, however, there is no solid evidence to support it."
            <br>Different environments may result in different behaviors. A simple instance is, when someone is too anxious, some light music may help him calm down. Following the melodious music, one can imagine being in a silent forest or deep sea. The music facilitates imagination, and imagination
           facilitates presence. Although this presence is very low level, it still has its usage.</p>

            <h3 class="section-heading">Response and Emotions</h3>

            <p>Another crucial function of presence is that a virtual experience can resonate  with the same reactions and emotions as a real experience.
            <br>A between-subject experiment held by Hodges et alprovided some interesting results. In the experiment, there are 10 subjects on a waitint list while another 10 is treated for fear of heights in VR. As the result,
            the subjects who were all acrophobia showed increasd subjectively reported anxiety when confronted with height in the VE. Further research showed taht the treatment in VR is not a joke. The acrophbia is indeed reduced, comparing to the waiting list.
          This findings is comfirmed later by other experiments on other phobias around the world.</p>

             <h4 class="section-heading">Not Benefits Only, Trouble As Well</h4>
            <p>It is not rare to hear someone feeling nauseating when they try to play some 3D games. The similar phenomenon also exist in use of VR. The nausea and dizziness caused by it is actually a result of protection system of human bodies. For instance,
            in a virtual environment, one is surrounded by winds and feels floating in the sky. Suddenly all of the winds begin to rise rapidly. This may make the person feel that (s)he is falling down from the sky, while actually he is still stand steadily on the ground.
          In this situation, eyes tell the cetral nervous system that the body is falling but vestibular apparatus claims the body is not moving. Then the central nervous system is perplexed. As the result it decides to send out some nerve signals that make the body uncomfortable to try to
        make the body stop the action, even though it can not understand what the body is doing on earth. </p>
