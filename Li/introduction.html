          <p style="font-size : 18px ;">Before discussing this, we can first get familiar with the definitions of presence in literature.
            <br>The first is social richness. This means an extent to describe the socialbility,sensativity and other charaters that is felt in interactions with other people.
          <br>The next is realism. this is another extent of what a medium can be perceived.
        <br>Followed by transportation, which is the thought of "I am here","We are together" and/or something like these.
      <br>The fourth is immersion, still an extent of the engagement of the senses pu into the mediated environment.
    <br>The last but one is social actor within medium, an extent again og how the audience respond socially to another's representation through a medium.
  <br>The medium as social actor is the last extent to which the medium itself is known as a social actor.</p>

              These six definitions may result in worries to freshers, however, when the topic is virtual environment or simply VR, the “presence” talked about always follows the concept of transportation. That is, people who are “trapped” in a virtual environment may have a thought that “I am in deep sea” or “I stand on the Moon”(“I am here”) . Another term, co-presence(or social presence) means the feeling of being together in a virtual world(“we are together”).</p>

              Not only that, other researchers also give more different definitions. Sheridan focuses on the difference between presence and telepresence.
              The former is the sence of being in a computer-generated world, while the later means the sence of being at a real remote location.
              <br><img src="img/picture2.jpg">
              <br>Heeterdivides presence into three kinds: personal presence, social presence and environmental presence. Personal presence means
              someone feeling like (s)he is a part of the virtual environment. Social presence is on the contract, that means someone feeling that other beings exist in the same VE as well.
              The environmental presence is in another perspective, which means the environment itself perceive and act with the person in VE.
              <br>Schloerdefinites two kinds of presence: subjective and objective presence. The former is like that someone considering that (s)he is present in the remote or virtual environment physically.
               The later means something like finishing an assignment. These two definitions are totally based on experience.
               <br>Slater and Wilbur also put forward the characters between "presence" and "immersion". In their opnion, presence is a subjective phenomenon, just like the thought of being in a VE. The immersion, ont ther contract, is an objective description of things in system, like the range of view.
              <br><img src="img/picture3.jpg">
               <br>Zeltzer claims that a VR system can be judged by its autonomy, interaction and presence. The autonomy means how much does a VE develop from just passive geometry. Interaction is the extent that parameters of VE can be improved at runtime. The presence here is the fidelity of useful
               input and output channels of sensations.
