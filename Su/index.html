              </h2>
        <p>What is Geometry and Scanning ? Geometry is a branch of mathematics concerned with questions of shape, size, relative position of figures, and the properties of space. Basically, Geometry and Scanning is using geometry to scan an object. For example,<a style="color:green;"> iPhone X is using facial recognition to unlock.</a> First step of facial recognition is scanning your face and analysis it.   Let's see a short video. This video will show a type of Geometry and Scanning which is geometry 3D scan and how it works. </p>

        <h2 style="font-family:arial;font-size:35px;text-align:left" >Examples of Geometry and Scanning <br>
              </h2>
		<p>The first example is <strong>3D modelling</strong> : 3D modelling is the process of developing a mathematical representation of any surface of an object in three dimensions. Almost all 3D models can be divided into two categories. <a style="color:red;">* Solid</a> – These models define the volume of the object they represent (like a rock).<a style="color:green;"> Solid models are mostly used for engineering and medical simulations, and are usually built with constructive solid geometry.</a><a style="color:red;"> * Shell/boundary </a>– these models represent the surface, e.g. the boundary of the object, not its volume (like an infinitesimally thin eggshell). Almost all visual models used in games and film are shell models. 3D models represent a physical body using a collection of points in 3D space, connected by various geometric entities such as triangles, lines, curved surfaces, etc. Being a collection of data (points and other information), 3D models can be created by hand, algorithmically (procedural modelling), or scanned. Their surfaces may be further defined with texture mapping. This tech could help us to print a 3D object or design a 3D object like building.</p>
		<p>The second example is <a style="color:orange;">Fingerprint Optical Scanner: A fingerprint scanner system has two basic jobs -- it needs to get an image of your finger, and it needs to determine whether <a style="color:green;">the pattern of ridges and valleys in this image matches the pattern of ridges and valleys in pre-scanned images.</a> Only specific characteristics, which are unique to every fingerprint, are filtered and saved as an encrypted biometric key or mathematical representation.<b> No image of a fingerprint is ever saved, only a series of numbers (a binary code), which is used for verification</b>. <strong>The algorithm cannot be reconverted to an image</strong>, so no one can duplicate your fingerprints.</p>

		<h2 style="font-family:arial;font-size:35px;text-align:left" >FUTURE ASPECTS<br>
              </h2>
		  <p> Coming up in the near future are some awesome and amazing things. You may even be lucky enough to be reading this when some if not all of them have become a fully-fledged reality. The future is an exciting place for the 3D model which is a type of Geometry and Scanning, in both how the public and professionals alike are going to not only be able to interact with them but create them too. While virtual reality 3D modelling isn’t yet a challenger to its mouse manipulated, screen-based brethren, there’s little doubt that this medium is going to create waves in the 3D modelling industry. After all part of the point of 3D modelling is creating something that can be viewed from all angles, meanwhile, we’re currently stuck with our eyes glued to a two-dimensional computer screen for backside numbing periods of time.</p>

     Ongoing Research <br>

              </h2>
              <p>Texture synthesis has grown into a mature field in computer graphics, allowing the synthesis of naturalistic textures and images from photographic exemplars. Surprisingly little work, however, has been dedicated to synthesizing tileable textures, that is, textures that when laid out in a regular grid of tiles form a homogeneous appearance suitable for use in memory-sensitive real-time graphics applications. One of the key challenges in doing so is that most natural input exemplars exhibit uneven spatial variations that, when tiled, show as repetitive patterns. We propose an approach to synthesize tileable textures while enforcing stationarity properties that effectively mask repetitions while maintaining the unique characteristics of the exemplar. One explores a number of alternative measures for texture stationarity and show how each measure can be integrated into a standard texture synthesis method (PatchMatch) to enforce stationarity at user-controlled scales.
